## kubecost-quickstart

# This project is deprecated in favor of the [Kubecost model](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-model).
Quickly install kube-state-metrics, prometheus, and grafana on your cluster with helm. Requires a helm installation.

> git clone https://github.com/AjayTripathy/kubecost-quickstart.git

> cd kubecost-quickstart
> 


We package a suggestion for roles and role-based access control for your helm service.From the kubecost-quickstart directory, run:

> kubectl apply -f helm.yaml 

After running this, or if you have your own helm service roles already set up, run:

> helm install --debug --dry-run cost-analyzer --name cost-analyzer --namespace monitoring

View the dashboard locally with

> kubectl port-forward --namespace monitoring  deployment/cost-analyzer-grafana 3000
